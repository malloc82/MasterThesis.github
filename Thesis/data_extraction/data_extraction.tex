\section{Introduction}
In order for our estimation to work we need to collect two different types of data for our calculations. 
One is the true geometric dimension of our phantom, the other is the corresponding distorted signal that
represent those known geometric locations inside MR images. Some of these data can be relied on manufacture's
measurement, while others would require us to extract information from various types of images to estimate the
measurements. In this chapter we will discuss how we obtain each measurements and algorithm involved in those
processes.
