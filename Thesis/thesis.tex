\AbstractText{Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides an excellent modality for distinguishing different tissues in the human body, which makes this modality essential for medical applications. MRI can also be used for treatment planning of medical procedures that require a great degree of geometrical accuracy such as functional radiosurgery. Unfortunately, the accuracy of MRI for medical targeting applications is compromised by the presence of geometric distortions such as non-linearities of the magnetic gradient fields or inhomogeneities of the scanner main field. Also, the correction method developed by a previous study cannot be applied due to the magnetic field inside current 3-Testla(T) scanner is much larger than the one used in previous study.\\
	The goal of this work was to develop and implement a numerical software-based method that can accurately correct the distortion of MR images generated by 3T MRI scanner. To accomplish this, a new phantom has been designed from scratch to capture the distortions inside 3T MRI scanner. An algorithm has been developed, based on the unique geometric feature of the new phantom, to estimate the location of gradient isocenter of the magnetic field inside 3T MRI scanner for the first time. Several other algorithms have also been developed to extract some unique features from CT and MR images of the new phantom. Using the calculated gradient isocenter and extracted data points, combining with some accurate geometric measurements of the new phantom, a set of correction parameters has been calculated. Simulated tests has shown that locations of data points corrected from MR images using the set of correction paramters are very close to their original locations. Further tests need to be performed in the future to expore the accuracy and limitations of this distortion correction algorithm developed in this work. \\
   %  Further tests is still to be conducted to characterize and finding the limitation of the this correction.

A new phantom has been designed from scratch to capture the distortions inside 3T MRI scanner. Several algorithms have also been develop to calculate the gradient isocenter of the 3T MRI scanner's magnetic field, extract relevant data points from the MR and CT images of new phantom and compute the undistortion parameters.abstract contents

\AcknowledgementText{
I would like to take this opportunity to thank the individuals who played a crucial role in my college education.\\
First and fore most, I would like to thank Dr. Schubert for giving me the oppportunity to work on the this
project and tirelessly mentoring me during the time. Under his guidance, I have not only expanded my knowledge
in mathematics and computer science area, I also have learned to be a better preson. Things I learned from him 
will be benefitial to the rest of my life.\\
I would also like to express my gratitude for Dr. Schulte, for patiently explaining things to me over and over 
again and providing funding for the crucial updates for the new phantom. The time that I have spent with Dr. 
Schulte has enabled me to greatly increase my knowledge in mathematics, physics, and radiation medicine. \\
My thanks also goes to Bob Jones who build the new phantom for us. With very limited resource avaiable to him,
he has done a tremendous job in making our new phantom design become a real thing. His input has been very 
valuable to this project.\\
At last, I would also like to thank to support from my family. Without them, especially my aunt, I would not
have to opportunity to study in the USA, and certainly would not be able to study computer science at this
point of my life.}
