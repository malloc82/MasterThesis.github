\section{Conclusion}

In conclusion, all major goals has been achieved:
\begin{enumerate}
\item A new phantom has been designed and manufactured to capture distortions inside 3T MRI scanner. This has 
  shown to work from the MR images.
\item An algorithm was developed to calculated the gradient isocenter of the magnetic field of 3T MRI scanner. 
  Simulated results as shown that this algorithm worked quite accurate.
\item Several algorithms were also developed to extract desired geometric information from the CT and MR images.
\item Finally, an algorithm was developed to calculate the correction parameters based on this new phantom's 
  feature.
\end{enumerate}

Further tests still need to be performed to further test the limitation of the this algorithm, e.g. is there
any region tends to be corrected better than others.
